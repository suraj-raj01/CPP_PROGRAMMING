/*

There are 4 Pillers of C++ (OOPs). 
1) Encapsulation
2) Abstraction
3) Inheritance
4) PolymorPhism

1) Encapsulation:-
   Binding of datamember and member function with the help of object in single
   unit is called an encapsulation.

2) Abstractions:-
   Encapsulation leads abstraction and with the help of it, we can only display
   or access the necessary desire function & hidden teh rest of things.

3) Inheritance:-
   Inheritance is one of the key feature of Object Oriented Programming in C++
   It allow us to create a new class (Derived Class) from an existing class or 
   (Base Class).

-> There are five types of inheritance in C++.
   a) single-level Inheritance.
   b) multi-level Inheritance.
   c) multiple Inheritance.
   d) Heirarchical Inheritance.
   e) Hybrid Inheritance.



4) PolymorPhism:-
   The world "Polymorphism" means having many forms. In simple words we can 
   define Polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displyed in more 
   than one form.
   
   Note:-
   A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have 
   different characteristics. A man at the same time is a fathers, husband, 
   brother, son and employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior
   in different situations.
