Core Concepts
 * Data Structures:
   * Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees (Binary, Binary Search, AVL, Heaps), Graphs
   * Understand their properties, operations, and use cases.
 * Algorithms:
   * Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick, Heap)
   * Searching (Linear, Binary)
   * Dynamic Programming
   * Greedy Algorithms
   * Divide and Conquer
   * Backtracking
   * Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford)
 * Time and Space Complexity:
   * Analyze the efficiency of algorithms.
   * Big O notation.
Problem-Solving Techniques
 * Problem Decomposition: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
 * Algorithm Design: Choose appropriate algorithms based on problem requirements.
 * Implementation: Write clean, efficient, and well-commented C++ code.
 * Testing: Thoroughly test your solutions to ensure correctness.
Practice and Interview Preparation
 * LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces: Practice coding challenges on these platforms.
