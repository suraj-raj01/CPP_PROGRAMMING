What is Data Structure:
Data structure is an arrangement of data in computers memory. Itmakes the data quickly
available to the processor for required  operations

It is a software artifact which allows data to be stored, organized 
and accessed.

Sorting:-
It is nothing but storage of data in sorted order

Shorting Technique: It depends on two parameters
a)Execution time of a program
b)Space taken by the program

Sorting can be perfomed using several Technique some are follows:
a)Bubble Sort
b)Insertion Sort
c)Selection Sort
d)Quick Sort
e)Merge Sort

//Viva Type Questions

// BUBBLE SORT

[6,2,9,5,8]
1. Based on Either -> Elements/Structure
2.Internal/External/Inplace/Not Inplace/Space Complexity
3.Stable/Not Stable
4.Time Complexity
5.Approach

1. -> Bubble Sort based on Structure as well as Elements.
2. -> Inplace, Space Complexity -> O(1).
3. -> Unstable (if in array have dublicate value the we can say Stable).
4. -> O(n) in best case if code will optimize O(n2) in worst case.
5. -> Subtract & Conqure.
